# Visualization for timeseries

- Time series (data, trend, seasonal, anomaly) visualization (Javascript - d3js)
- Some algorithms to detect anomaly (points, trend) and calculate (trend, seasonal) as well. (Python)
- Sever code (Python)


First of all, the server code will take data, then give it for the js code. js will call the algorithms to handle data, recieve the result then plot it to web browser. It's totally automatic.
